# challenge-02

## Description
Here is a rough draft of a portfolio website that I will later use to store my various projects. By clicking the links in the header, the website will scroll down to the corresponding section of the page.The links at the bottom of the page allow the user to easily be able to contact me through various avenues. By clicking the project cards in the portfolio, it redirects the user to my various projects. Finally, since I have only 3 deployed projects, the first three cards in the portfolio section lead to those said projects.
